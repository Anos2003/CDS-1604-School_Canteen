How to use this Overleaf package

1. Open Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com) and create a new project ("Upload Project").
2. Upload the folder contents of `overleaf/` (this includes `main.tex`).
3. Add screenshots or images into the `images/` subfolder on Overleaf (e.g. `menu_screenshot.png`).
4. Ensure the project has the necessary LaTeX packages (Overleaf provides them by default). If you use minted, enable shell-escape (not used here).
5. Click "Recompile" — the PDF report will be generated from `main.tex`.

Notes:
- The LaTeX file is written in Vietnamese with UTF-8 encoding. Overleaf supports this by default.
- If you want me to expand the report (add diagrams, more screenshots, or auto-insert code listings from the repo), tell me which parts to include and I will update `main.tex` accordingly.
